-   Given your to topic(s), where would you find data about it? Provide at least two sources, being as specific as possible. If you need to collect/scrape it yourself, describe the steps you'd need too take.

-   What challenges do you imagine having? How might you overcome them?  

-   Type your responses below and save it on Rmarkdown.
